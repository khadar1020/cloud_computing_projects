# Scheduling Algorithm in CloudSim

## Overview

**Scheduling Algorithm in CloudSim** is a cloud computing project that involves implementing and evaluating various scheduling algorithms within the CloudSim simulation framework. This project focuses on optimizing resource allocation and improving the overall performance of cloud computing systems.

CloudSim is a popular cloud simulation toolkit used to model and simulate cloud environments, enabling researchers and developers to test cloud computing algorithms without requiring an actual cloud infrastructure. In this project, we explore different scheduling strategies and their impact on resource utilization, execution time, and system efficiency.

## Objectives

- Implement various scheduling algorithms such as Round Robin, First-Come-First-Served, and custom-designed algorithms.
- Simulate cloud resource allocation to optimize task execution and reduce overall costs.
- Evaluate performance under varying conditions such as different workloads and cloud resources.
- Compare the performance of different scheduling algorithms in terms of execution time, resource utilization, and energy efficiency.

## Features

- **CloudSim Framework**: Utilizes CloudSim for cloud environment simulation and resource management.
- **Task Scheduling**: Implements and evaluates multiple scheduling strategies for optimal resource allocation.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Provides detailed reports on the performance of each algorithm under simulated conditions.
- **Customization**: Allows the addition of new scheduling algorithms for further testing and evaluation.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or above.
- **CloudSim**: The CloudSim toolkit for simulating cloud computing environments.
- **Eclipse IDE or any Java IDE**: For running the project.

## Setup and Installation
